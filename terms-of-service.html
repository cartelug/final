                        <p>Welcome to Cartelug! Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using our services. By using Cartelug's services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

                        <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
                        <p>Cartelug provides support and facilitation services for accessing premium streaming platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, and Spotify Premium. We also offer services to boost Instagram likes. Our primary service areas are Uganda and South Sudan.</p>

                        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
                        <p>Our services are intended for users in Uganda and South Sudan. By using our services, you represent that you meet any age or other eligibility requirements applicable in your jurisdiction.</p>

                        <h2>3. Ordering and Account Setup</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ordering:</strong> To order a service, you must select a package and provide required details (like your name and payment method) through the order forms on our website (e.g., for Netflix, Prime Video, Spotify, Instagram Likes Boost). Order completion typically involves proceeding to WhatsApp with your order details.</li>
                            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> For Spotify Premium, the service is typically applied to your own existing account. For Netflix and Prime Video, details regarding account access (e.g., number of devices) are provided. For Instagram Likes Boost, you must provide your Instagram username. You are responsible for providing accurate information.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><strong>Payment Issues:</strong> If you encounter payment-related pop-ups (e.g., on Netflix), please attempt to dismiss them first, as service may continue normally. If issues persist, contact support.</li>
